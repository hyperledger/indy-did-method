## Privacy Considerations

Given that Indy is a publicly readable, immutable ledger, no personally identifiable information, including DIDs where a person is the DID Subject, should be placed on the network.

### DID Core Specification Privacy Considerations

The requirements for all DID method specifications when authoring the Privacy Considerations section are:

- The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any subsection of [Section 5 of RFC6973](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973#section-5) that could apply in a method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.
  - surveillance
  - stored data compromise
  - unsolicited traffic
  - misattribution
  - correlation
  - identification
  - secondary use
  - disclosure
