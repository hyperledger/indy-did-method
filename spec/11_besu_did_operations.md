## did:indy:besu Operations

There is a description of a storage format, types and operations that are available in case of using [`indy-besu`](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-besu) repository.

### Storage format

DID Records collection contains `DidRecord` structures consisting of DID Document and `DidMetadata`

```
struct DidRecord {
             bytes document;
             DidMetadata metadata;
}
struct DidMetadata {
            address owner;
            uint256 created;
            uint256 updated;
            uint256 versionId;
            bool deactivated;
}
```

Example:

```
      {
          "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266": {
              document: bytes("
                  {
                      "@context": [
                          "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
                           "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
                      ],
                      "id": "did:indy:besu:0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
                      "verificationMethod": [{
                          "id": "did:indy:besu:0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266#key-1",
                          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
                          "controller": "did:indy:besu:0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
                          "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
                      }],
                      "authentication": ["did:indy:besu:0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266#key-1"],
                  }
              "), 
              metadata: {
                  owner: 0x93917cadbace5dfce132b991732c6cda9bcc5b8a,
                  created: 1234,
                  updated: 1234,
                  versionId: 1234,
                  deactivated: false
              }, 
          },
          ...
      }
```

### Types definition

#### DidDocument

DID Document must match to the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

#### DID Document metadata

Each DID Document MUST have a metadata section when a representation is produced. It can have the following properties:

* owner (address): An address of DID owner
* created (timestamp): Time of a block ordered a transaction for DID Doc creation
* updated (timestamp): The updated field is null if an Update operation has never been performed on the DID document
  Time of a block ordered a transaction changed a DID Doc last time
* versionId (number): Block number when DID was created or updated
* deactivated (string): If DID has been deactivated, DID document metadata MUST include this property with the boolean
  value true. By default, this is set to false.

### DIDDoc Validation

There is no specific validation of DID Document on the ledger side. It is implemented in Indy Besu VDR code instead.

### Transactions (Smart Contract's methods)

Contract name: **IndyDidRegistry**

#### Create DID

* Method: `createDid`
    * Description: Transaction to create a new DID record (DID Document and corresponding DID Metadata)
    * Parameters:
        * `identity` - Address of DID owner
        * `document` - DID Document JSON as bytes
    * Restrictions:
        * DID must not exist
        * Valid DID must be provided
        * Sender must be equal to identity
        * Sender must have either TRUSTEE or ENDORSER or STEWARD role assigned
    * Format:
        ```
        IndyDidRegistry.createDid(
          address identity, 
          bytes document
        )
        ```
    * Example:

        )
        ```
    * Raised Event:
        * `DIDCreated(identity)`

          bytes calldata document
        )
        ```
    * Example:
        ```
        IndyDidRegistry.updatedDid(
          "0xa9b7df62c953c4c49deebea05d3c8fee1f47c1f6"
          "{ did document as json bytes }" 
        )
        ```
    * Raised Event:
        * `DIDUpdated(identity)`

#### Deactivate DID

* Method: `deactivateDid`
    * Description: Transaction to deactivate an existing DID
    * Parameters:
        * `identity` - Address of DID owner
    * Restrictions:
        * DID must exist
        * DID must be active
        * Sender must be equal to identity
        * Sender must be either identity owner or have a TRUSTEE role assigned

        IndyDidRegistry.deactivateDid( 
          address identity
        )
        ```

        )
        ```
    * Raised Event:
        * `DIDDeactivated(identity)`

#### Endorsement flow

Not all identity owners may have permissions for writing transactions on the ledger.

For endorsement flow `IndyDidRegistry` contains methods: `createDidSigned`, `updateDidSigned` and `deactivateDidSigned`. They duplicate `createDid`, `updateDid` and `deactivateDid` with additional `signature` parameter.
`Signature` is EcDSA signature by the DID author's Ethereum identity account keys.

#### Resolve DID Document with Meta

* Method: `resolveDid`
    * Description: Transaction to resolve DidDocStorage entry (DID Document and corresponding DID Doc Metadata)
    * Parameters:
        * `identity` - Address of the DID identity to be resolved
    * Restrictions:
        * DID must exist
    * Format:
        ```
        IndyDidRegistry.resolveDid(
          address identity,
        ) returns (DidRecord didRecord)
        ```
    * Example:
        ```
        IndyDidRegistry.resolveDid(
          "0xa9b7df62c953c4c49deebea05d3c8fee1f47c1f6"
