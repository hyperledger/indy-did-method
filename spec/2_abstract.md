## Abstract

Indy is a public ledger designed specifically and only for privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity. A Hyperledger Indy ledger is designed specifically to enable the use of verifiable credentials, allowing credential issuers to publish data necessary for issuing verifiable credentials and constructing presentations from those verifiable credentials. This specification covers how DIDs on an Indy ledger are managed and the operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting DIDs.
